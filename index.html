        <h2>For Immediate release:</h2>
        <p><strong>Date:</strong> November 1, 2023</p>

        <p>Mad Scientist Nuts, premiere producer of PIZOOTZ Infused Peanuts, Almonds, Pumpkin Seeds, and Trail Mixes is
            temporarily pausing production.</p>

        <p>The effect of covid on the buying cycles of retailers, inflation that followed, and the inability of
            management to raise capital for needed expansion of infrastructure are the main reasons for this pause.
            Management has high hopes that a funding opportunity will come to the company, the patented process that
            makes the infusion so special and all the registered US trademarks are available for licencing. The Pizootz
            patent also covers Potato Chips and other not yet announced incredible products. Selling to and shelf
            position in stores has changed dramatically in the last two years. The company has been shifting to private
            labels and co-branding, but the changes have been challenging for the company. Without fresh capital it
            cannot expand to produce at the required levels. Any interest in a cutting-edge high-tech snack company
            should contact management.</p>
